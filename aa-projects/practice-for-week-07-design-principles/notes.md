# Design Notes
-- Website Github --

Likes
1. Pressing / allows us to type into the search bar
2. At a quick glance, tells us our popular repos
3. Shows us a feed(beta) of the repos we use/follow and their latest changes
4. Shows us the recent blog posts from Github
5. I like the three column layout, it reminds me of the layout I use when coding in Visual Studio Code(files | current code file | other code/note file)

Dislikes
1. What if I wanted to see  updates to a particular repo on my home feed?
2. Search bar takes up the entire focus when we go to type
3. I don't like the way avatars are displayed.  They don't care if the page is black and the avatar is white.  It creates this shining light in the late of night effect
4. I don't want to see other repos to explore -> I can simply search for them

Changes
1. I'd change avatar icons to prevent the lights in the night look
2. I'd reduce the focus on the search bar when searching.  Why does it need the full focus?
3. I'd let users set their preferences for seeing their repos, newest, top, oldest, most popular, etc
