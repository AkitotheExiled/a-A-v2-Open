# Exercise: HTML Wireframe

Wireframes are quick, lightweight outlines design specs that layout a web page.
Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have
a solid foundation to build on. This is an important skill when you work on
web design and development.

In this exercise, you will be identifying and discussing semantic HTML syntax
from an example wireframe.

Identify what HTML elements you think each part in the wireframe should be.

Which parts in the wireframe should the following HTML tags be assigned to?

- Main Heading (h1)
--> Lorem Ipsum dolor title thingy
- Subheading (h2)
--> The lore
- Main Image (img)
--> Obv the only image on the page
- Text paragraphs (p)
---> The lore and the ipsum would be paragraphs
- Links (underlined blue text) (a)
---> The links would be the additional resources towards the bottom of the article,
Links towards the bottom of the page for the footer
Links towards the top for the different navigation options
- Lists (ul, ol, li)
---> The links would be contained in a UL list
- Sections (div)
--> I would create a section for everything,
A section to hold the entire post
A section for the title content/image
A section for the lore and ipsum
A section for the links below
A section within those links to contain the different sections

- Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)
--> Icons will be placed under the title where f, t currently exist

Are there any other HTML tags that should be assigned to a part in the
wireframe?
