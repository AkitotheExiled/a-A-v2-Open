// BENEFITS OF PAIR PROGRAMMING

/*

1. Brief history of team/pair programming
2. Typical roles when pairing up
3. Benefits??

*/

/* Team Mentality

1. Developers share one device
2. Everyone has a job
3. Everyone gets a turn
4. No one is too good to pair

Mob programming -> 3+ developers

Extreme Programming -> team rotates through projects

/*

/* Roles of Pair Programming

* Driving
-> Types the code, asking questions, suggest improvements/refactor as project continues

* Navigating
-> Leads discussion and directs the driver about what to type.  Double checks code for errors

*/

// Why?

// 15% slower but 15% fewer errors overall -> More social interaction + team development





// Pair Programming - a/A Way

/*

1. a/A path to pair programming success
2. Quick routine for improving pairing outcomes
3. Modifications for specific scenarios

*/

// Rules

/*

1. Partner Up
2. Check in -> What will you be working on?  How long do you expect to last?  Any breaks during this session?
----Establish roles here----
3. Coding together - one monitor/one editor, other is watching/talking only -> 15 minute intervals
4. Hand-off -> 15 minute intervals only -> stick to the timer
5. Follow-up -> reflect on your session.  Did you meet your goals?  Celebrate! are there still incomplete tasks?

*/

// Modifying the routine

/*

1. Step back & discuss.  Having trouble keeping up?  Pause the timer and step away.  Both need to move together
2. Focus on the process during your follow-up. -> Discuss communication
3. Reflect regularly

*/




// Empathetic Communication

/*

1. Empathetic communication when coding
2. How to critique others work
3. How to respond and receive critism

*/

// Use code-centric language

/*

// Human-centric
"You wrote an infinite loop.
If you do that again, you will crash the server."

// Code-centric
"The code submitted for issue #3 resulted in an infinite loop.
This behavior could crash the server.
What can we do to prevent that in the future?"

*/


// Applying empathy to pair programming

// YOU ARE NOT YOUR CODE

/*

// Human-centric
"Why did you you write the function the wrong way?"

// Code-centric
"Is this an alternative syntax for a function?"

*/
